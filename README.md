# SimonGame
This game is modeled off the game Simon. So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a
tile that you have to click on.And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point
you will record a wrong pattern,and the game is over.Then, you can press any key to restart the game.

This game was built using HTML,CSS,JS and used jquery to traverse the HTML DOM tree to dynamically access and update the
content, structure, and style of the website.
